What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
In a git repository there is a hidden file '.git' which tracks the files in the 
repository.
This is the main difference between a standard directory and a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The value of the staging area is that I don't have to do multiple commits on my 
own but I can add all the files I want to commit into one area and just do one 
commit by myself.
