When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to create a remote repository when I work on multiple devices, like one is on my workstation at work and the other one is at home

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to work on a constant basis, but when the basis changes also my inteded work maybe needs a change?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches? When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a feature from github. I can get the repository from anyone sharing their repository by forking it.
I can clone a shared repository, by pushing and pulling I will interact with this repository and not with a forked one.
Branches are on my local machine. A unmerged commit is a branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When I'm disconnected from the internet, I still can have access to my work.

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git or Github I would try sending the files via email or dropbox or manually via a USB stick.
It would be much easier to understand. Using git is in the beginning very difficult, but I think from time to time it will get easier.
My method will get harder in bigger projects where more people would work on one project.
