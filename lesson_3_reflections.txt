When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to create a remote repository when I work on multiple devices, like one is on my workstation at work and the other one is at home

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to work on a constant basis, but when the basis changes also my inteded work maybe needs a change?
